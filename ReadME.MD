I referred to Kh-kim's lecture: https://github.com/kh-kim/

Purpose: Studying deep learning with MNIST using CLI environment and simple CNN models.

### 'MNIST_유치원'
This marks my initial attempt at running deep learning models in a CLI environment.

### 'MNIST_딥러닝초급'
I separated 'data_loader.py' to enhance data loading efficiency.

### 'MNIST_딥러닝초급_2'
I attempted to create a simple 'data_loader.py' using the zip function, but I encountered issues. I plan to work on it further to make it functional.

### 'MNIST_딥러닝초급_Autoencoder'
I delved into the study of autoencoders with MNIST.
I visualized MNIST coordinates in the R^2 space, which is the bottleneck layer.
I displayed MNIST figures after passing them through the decoder.

MINIST with CNN models will be uploaded upon completion of the study. Stay tuned! :-)
